# my-music-app

All source code used is within either the backend folder or the my-interactive-map folder.

Within backed all .js files are ones thats I used with app.js being the main server file.

For my-interactive-map in order to see my .jsx files you will also have to look inside the Components folder, which contains all the components which I worked on.
